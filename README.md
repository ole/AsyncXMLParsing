An [`AsyncSequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence) wrapper for Foundationâ€™s [`XMLParser`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/xmlparser).

Completely experimental, not intended for production use.

Note: The code is packaged in an iOS 15 app because this is currently the easiest environment for me to run async/await code. Run the unit tests in the iOS simulator to see the code in action.
